# MyReads Project

Book shelf project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 

This application allows you to manage your book collection on three shelves:
* Currently Reading
* Want To Read
* Read

From the main screen you can go to a search screen by hitting the Add button

On the search screen new books can be added to your collection

## Running the Application

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the application with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
